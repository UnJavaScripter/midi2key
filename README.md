# MIDI2Key

An experiment that uses a Novation Launchpad mini MK2 MIDI Launchpad to control the host computer.

It currently controls basic media settings: pause, play, previous and next, and also volume up and down.

[RobotJS](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs) is being used to simulate the keyboard shortcuts. More shortcuts can be added.

It features "key animation" and "hold key" states.
